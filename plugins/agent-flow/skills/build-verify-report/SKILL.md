name: build-verify-report
description: Run every verify axis (lint, types, tests, coverage, the issue's criteria, query counts, security, browser) and write one report page with the real numbers and screenshots, then open it. Use for /verify, or when the user asks for the verification report of a change.

# Build the verify report

One command runs every axis, reads the numbers from the real output (nothing is retyped), writes a single page and opens it, so the user only has to look. The report is written also when something fails.

## Run it

```
uv run python <this skill's folder>/build_report.py --title "<issue title>" \
  --criteria <criteria file> [--review <review file>] (--browser --spec <file> | --no-ui) [--no-open]
```

`<this skill's folder>` is the base directory Claude Code gives when this skill loads: an absolute path in the installed plugin. Run the script from there as one plain command, with no pipe, redirection or `2>&1`, and never from `../plugins/agent-flow/` in the repository: only that plain call runs without a prompt, so any other form stops a loop build.

Input files: write the criteria file to `out/verify-input/criteria.json` and the screens file to `out/verify-input/spec.json` with the Write tool, and run `build_report.py` with those relative paths as one plain command.

- **A task that changes a screen:** `--browser --spec <file>`, where the file is the issue's `## Screens to capture` block copied unchanged. It runs the `check-in-browser` skill on those steps only, and the report shows each step's full page next to its close-up (`<name> (close-up)`) when the step gives `capture`. There are no default pages any more: `--browser` without `--spec` makes the Browser axis `FAIL` with `no screens given: pass --spec from the issue's "Screens to capture"`. A step whose `capture` matched nothing visible makes the Browser axis `FAIL` and names the step. In the report a click on a screenshot opens it full size; click again or press Escape to close it.
- **A task that changes no screen:** `--no-ui`. No browser runs, the Browser axis reads `NOT APPLICABLE` (`the task changes no screen`) and the report has no screenshots. `NOT APPLICABLE` does not make the verdict `INCOMPLETE`. The masking status is then `clean` when no report text holds personal data, so the report can still be shared.
- `--browser` and `--no-ui` together are refused (exit code 2). With neither, the Browser axis is `NOT CONFIGURED`.
- The report is `out/verify/<time>/report.html` (one self-contained page, git-ignored) and `report.json`. It opens by itself unless `--no-open` is given.
- It takes about half a minute: it runs the same checks as the automatic checks on GitHub.

## The criteria file (you write it)

The program cannot judge an issue's own criteria; you check each one (in the running app or with a test) and record the result:

```
{"criteria": [
   {"text": "<a Done when or acceptance criterion>", "status": "PASS", "evidence": "<what you saw or ran>"}
 ],
 "check_yourself": ["<a step the user can try in the app>", "<another step>"]}
```

`status` is `PASS`, `FAIL` or `NOT CONFIGURED` (when it cannot be checked, say why in `evidence`). `check_yourself` comes from the issue's "Steps to check the result" or "How to check it when built".

## The review file (optional)

When the review step ran, save its summary as a text file whose **first line** is `Status: PASS` or `Status: FAIL`; it is shown in the report.

## Read the result

| Exit code | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | PASS | every axis passed |
| 1 | FAIL | at least one axis failed: show which, with its evidence |
| 2 | INCOMPLETE | no axis failed, but some are NOT CONFIGURED (for example no criteria, or no browser): say which and why |

Give the user the verdict, the path of the report and the failed axes, then stop at Gate 2. Never write PASS for an axis the report does not show as PASS.

## Masking

The report carries a `masking` status (`clean`, `findings` or `not run`) in `report.json`: clean only when the browser run was clean (or `--no-ui` was given) and no text of the report (title, criteria, review) holds personal data. Findings make the Browser axis FAIL and block sharing. `--plant "<text>"` is for testing the scan only.

## Rules

- The screenshots show demo data only. Do not publish or share the report here: sharing is a separate step with its own checks.
- Do not edit the report by hand; rerun the program.

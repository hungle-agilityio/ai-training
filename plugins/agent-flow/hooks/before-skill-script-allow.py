"""Before every Bash call: allow, without a prompt, a script of one of this plugin's skills.

The call arrives as JSON on stdin. A command is allowed only when it is one plain call of
`python3 [-I] <script> [args]` or `uv run python[3] <script> [args]`, with no shell operator,
redirection, substitution or variable, and the script, once its real path is resolved (links and
`..` included), is a `.py` file directly inside `skills/<skill>/` of this plugin. Then the hook
answers `allow`. In loop mode (FLOW_LOOP=1 or REVIEWRADAR_LOOP=1) a command that names such a
script but is not that plain call is denied, with the plain form as the reason: nobody is there to
answer a prompt. Anything else gets no answer, so the permission rules decide as usual. The other
hooks still run and can still block. A plugin's path holds its version, so no permission rule can
name these scripts safely: a `*` for the version also matches `..` (plugin README, "Probe").

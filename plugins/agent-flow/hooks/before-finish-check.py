"""Before Claude stops, in loop mode only: do not finish while lint, types or tests fail.

Runs as a Stop hook. Exit code 2 sends stderr back to Claude and keeps it working.
Loop mode is on when FLOW_LOOP=1 or REVIEWRADAR_LOOP=1; in an interactive session this hook
does nothing. The checks are `checks.commands` of ops/flow.toml, run in order.
A pull request round (the tick wrote out/pr-round.json) that added commits must also have
republished its verify report to a link (an `allowed ... url=` line in out/artifact-publish.log),
built at the new HEAD, and with screenshots when the issue has needs-ui (`"ui": true`).
A second stop in a row is always allowed (stop_hook_active), so a stuck issue ends in the
report as failed instead of looping for ever.

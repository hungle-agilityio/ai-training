# Spec: <feature>

<!-- Copy to specs/<feature>/spec.md. The ACs are the contract: the build and the review are checked against them. -->

## Summary

<the change in plain words; which page, report or data it touches, or "nothing visible to users">

## Acceptance criteria

Each AC can be checked by a person or a test, with exact values, pages or texts. Write the test rule as "every test on `main` passes unchanged". In an epic, a task that changes a number or behaviour set by an earlier task names it in its ACs (ADR-022).
